An escape sequence is a combination of characters that represents a special or non-printable character
in a string or character literal. It is used to include characters that are not easily representable
or to represent certain actions or formatting.

In most programming languages, including C++, the escape sequence begins with a backslash (\) followed
by one or more characters. When the compiler encounters an escape sequence, it interprets it as a
special character or performs a specific action.

Here are some common escape sequences used in C++:

\\: Represents a backslash character.
\": Represents a double quotation mark character.
\': Represents a single quotation mark character.
\n: Represents a newline character.
\t: Represents a tab character.
\r: Represents a carriage return character.
\b: Represents a backspace character.
\f: Represents a form feed character.
\a: Represents an alert (bell) character.
\v: Represents a vertical tab character.
\0: Represents the null character.
For example, if you want to include a double quotation mark within a string literal, you would use
the escape sequence \" to represent it.
