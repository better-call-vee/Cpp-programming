/**
suppose, there are 4 cities A, B, C, D. Here, A is connected with B; B is connected
with C; and D is connected with C & B. If you want to go C from A, at first you need
to go from A to B, then B to C.
So here the cities are the nodes and the routes are the edges. There are 4 edges.
       A----B
            /\
           /  \
          /    \
         /      \
        C--------D
Like this.
There can be graph without any edge. There can be graph which has a single node
There can be graph with a single node and the node has it's own edge. it's self
loop.
A node can contain more than one edge.

Nodes are also addressed as vertices(plural of vertex)

a graph can contain many vertices and no edges. Such a graph is called a
"vertex set" or "point set". It consists of a collection of isolated vertices
with no connections between them.

In graph theory, a graph with no edges is called an "edgeless graph" or "null
graph". An edgeless graph can have any number of vertices, including zero, one,
two, or more. An edgeless graph with one vertex is called a "singleton graph",
and an edgeless graph with two vertices is called a "doubleton graph".
