//Suppose we want to cross a road. We look left and right over and over to do that.

An algorithm is a set of steps or instructions that are followed to solve a
problem or complete a task. It is a sequence of actions that can be executed by
a computer to accomplish a specific goal. In C++, algorithms are used to
manipulate data structures like arrays, vectors, and strings.

Think of an algorithm like a recipe for baking a cake. Just as a recipe lists
out the necessary ingredients and steps to create a delicious cake, an algorithm
lists out the necessary steps to solve a particular problem. Each step in the
algorithm is like a separate instruction in the recipe. Just as following the
recipe exactly will result in a perfect cake, following the algorithm precisely
will result in a correct solution to the problem.

For example, let's say you want to sort a list of numbers in ascending order.
The algorithm for sorting can be broken down into a few simple steps:

Compare the first two numbers in the list.
If the first number is greater than the second number, swap their positions.
Move on to the next two numbers and repeat step 2.
Continue this process until you have compared and swapped all of the numbers in
the list.

Another example of an algorithm is finding the largest number in an array. The
algorithm for finding the largest number can be broken down into the following
steps:

Start by assuming that the first number in the array is the largest.
Compare this number with the next number in the array.
If the next number is larger, update the largest number variable to be the next
number.
Repeat this process for all of the numbers in the array.
Once you have gone through all of the numbers in the array, the largest number
variable will contain the largest number.
In summary, an algorithm is a sequence of steps used to solve a problem or
complete a task. It can be thought of as a recipe that must be followed precisely
in order to achieve the desired result.
