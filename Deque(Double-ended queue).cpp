//A deque (double-ended queue) is an abstract data type that implements a dynamic
//array allowing additions and deletions from both front and rear. It is an ordered
//sequence of elements where an element can be inserted or removed from both the
//front and the rear in constant time. The deque class in C++ is a container adaptor
//that provides a double-ended queue, implemented as a dynamic array. It is part of
//the Standard Template Library (STL) and can be used to store elements of any type
//that satisfies the requirements of the Element type.
