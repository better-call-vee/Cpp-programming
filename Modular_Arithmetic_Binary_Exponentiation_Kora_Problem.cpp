Here, they asked to output the summation of A^i where i = 0 to X - 1
And in MOD (M).
The MOD is not meant to be a prime for sure here. So, we can't apply
the geometric progression which is super easy.
i = x - 1
 âˆ‘  a^i   => (a^x - 1) % M / (a - 1)
i = 0
here, the modular multiplicative inverse of a - 1 can't be calculated
as MOD and (a - 1)'s GCD must be 1 which is not ensured here.

Now, there is only another way. To do this.
The complexity will be (logn)^2
With Binary exponentiation.

Here, the main logic is Divide & Conquer.
a^0 + a^1 + a^2 + a^3 + ... + a^(x - 1)
suppose, the x - 1 is 7.
so,
0 1 2 3 | 4 5 6 7
after dividing by 2, we get the summation of a^0, a^1, a^2, a^3.
THEN, if we do, a^4(a^0 + a^1 + a^2 + a^3),
what do we get??
=> we get exactly the summation of right portion.
Now, for odd x / even x - 1:
we get:
0 1 2 3 | 4 5 6 7 8
here we just add the a^8 with the total answer.
