To calculate the number of edges in a complete graph with n nodes, you need to
know that every node is connected to every other node. Therefore, for each of
the n nodes, there are n - 1 edges connecting it to the other nodes (since it
is not connected to itself).

However, since we count each edge twice (once for each of the two nodes it
connects), we need to divide the total count by 2 to get the total number of
edges in the complete graph. The formula to calculate the number of edges in
a complete graph with n nodes is:

(number of edges = n * (n - 1) / 2)




In graph theory, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges that are incident
to it.

An analogy to help understand vertex degree could be to think of a group of people
at a party. Each person can be thought of as a vertex, and each conversation they
have with another person can be thought of as an edge.

The degree of a person at the party would be the number of conversations they have
had with other people. For example, if person A has talked to 4 other people
(B, C, D, and E), then their degree would be 4.

Similarly, in a graph, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges that are
incident to it. If a vertex has a high degree, it means that it is connected
to many other vertices in the graph, much like a person at a party who has had
many conversations. Conversely, a vertex with a low degree is connected to fewer
vertices, much like a person who has only had a few conversations.




The degree-sum formula, also known as the Handshaking Lemma, states that in any
undirected graph:

sum of degrees of all vertices = 2 x (number of edges)

In mathematical notation, this can be written as:

∑ deg(v) = 2 |E|

where:

∑ is the summation symbol
deg(v) is the degree of vertex v
|E| is the number of edges in the graph
This formula holds true for all undirected graphs, including simple graphs,
multigraphs, and pseudographs.




The maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph can be calculated using the
following formula:
max_edges = n1 * n2

where n1 and n2 are the number of vertices in the two disjoint sets of the bipartite graph.
If a bipartite graph has 10 vertices, it can be partitioned into two disjoint
sets of vertices with 5 vertices in each set. Let these sets be denoted by U
and V, where |U| = |V| = 5.

The maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph occurs when every vertex in
U is connected to every vertex in V, and there are no edges between vertices
in the same set. This is known as a complete bipartite graph, denoted by K5,5.

The number of edges in K5,5 is given by:

|U| × |V| = 5 × 5 = 25

Therefore, the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph having 10 vertices
is 25.




By Euler's formula for planar graphs, we have:

v - e + r = 2,

where v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and r is the
number of regions.

Substituting the given values, we get:

6 - 7 + r = 2

r = 3

Therefore, the connected planar graph with 6 vertices and 7 edges contains 3
regions.
