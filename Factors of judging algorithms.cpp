//input 2 numbers. add 2 numbers. result. this is constant
//input n numbers. add n numbers. result. this is variable

//O() -> big O notation. -> represents upper bound
//Ω() -> omega notation. -> lower bound
//θ() -> Theta notation. -> upper and lower bound

//time and space judgement

//O(1) -> big O of 1 -> means constant operation
//O(n) -> order n -> complexity is variable
//O(n^k), O(nlogn), O(nrootn) , O(2^n), O(e^n)

//a modern computer can execute 10^9 operations in 1s.
